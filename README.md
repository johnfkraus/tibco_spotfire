Virgil Keith at Blue Canopy Group asked me to familiarize myself with TIBCO. Bypassing the canned example data sets, I decided to test TIBCO against an unclassified data set on worldwide terrorist activity.  TIBCO Spotfire made it easy to produce these visualizations in less than one day, even though I never used TIBCO before.
